<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">finished basket, and number each tenon and mortise. Mark all the mortises on the posts, being sure to keep the distances between the top and lower rail the same on each post. Cut each mortise to fit the correspondingly numbered tenon. Next, mark the mortises for the slats in the rails, allowing the whole slat to go in 1/4 in.</p><p>The handles are next in order. The pieces going into the rail should be fastened with a round   1/2-in. tenon cut on one end and glued in place. The crosspiece should be mortised all the way through these pieces and held in place by a brad from the under side.</p><p>Now put the whole basket together without gluing, in order that errors, if any, may be detected.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">If everything fits perfectly, the basket is ready to be glued. For best results hot glue should be used. First glue up two opposite sides with the slats in place. Clamps must be used. When these have set for at least 24 hours, the other rails and slats may be glued in place</p></div> </div>
