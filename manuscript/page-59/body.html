<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The drawing giving the dimensions for constructing the seat shows how the parts are put together. The front and back apron pieces are mortised to receive a 1-in. square tenon cut on the crosspieces that support the slats. Each end of the apron pieces extends 4 in., and a hole is bored at A into which the hanging ropes or chains are fastened. If ropes are used, bore the holes to fit the rope and when the end of each rope is put through a hole it is tied in a knot to keep from slipping out. Chains can be fastened with eye bolts. Small carriage or stove bolts are used to hold the slats on the framework and cross pieces. The arm rests are fastened with wood screws.</p><p><img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/mission-furniture-vol-i/master/assets/images/i-048.jpg" alt> Details of Seat</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The drawing for the stand gives all the dimensions for its construction.
