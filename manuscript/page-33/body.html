These cushions may be filled with hair or cotton felt. Denim or burlap may also be used as a covering and are much less expensive than the leather. Lace one side and the two ends, then place filling and finish lacing.</p><p>Art leather cushions retail at from $16 to $20 a pair and the denim and burlap at $6 to $9.</p><p>The bottom cushion should be made the full size of the chair. The front and back rails extend a little above the slats and thus hold it in place. The back cushion will settle down a little and therefore may be made nearly the full length from the slats to the top of the back.</p><p>HOME-MADE MISSION BOOK RACK</p></div> </div>
