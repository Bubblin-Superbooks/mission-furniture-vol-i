<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The seat should be made of one piece if possible, otherwise two or more boards will have to be glued together. The corners should be cut out to fit around the posts. It rests on the side rails and cleats fastened to the inner side of the end rails.</p><p>When the window seat is complete go over it carefully and scrape all the surplus glue from about the joints, as the finish will not take where there is any glue. Remove all rough spots with fine sandpaper,  then apply the stain best liked, which may be any one of the many mission stains supplied by the trade for this purpose. If this window seat is well made and finished, it will be an ornament to any home.</p><p><img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/mission-furniture-vol-i/master/assets/images/i-109.jpg" alt> Detail of the Hall or Window Seat</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
