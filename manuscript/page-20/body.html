It is well to cut each piece a little longer than required so that the ends which are imperfectly formed may be cut off. These rods should fit tight and may be fastened in addition with a small screw or nail from the under or back side.</p><p><img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/mission-furniture-vol-i/master/assets/images/i-016.jpg" alt> Porch Chair Finished</p><p>The hand rests should be nailed to the arms with small nails or brads before the arms are bolted. The illustration of the assembled chair shows the relative position.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The bolts should be 1/4 in. and of the following lengths: 4 bolts 2-1/4 in. long; 2 bolts 2 in. long; 2 bolts 3 in. long. Washers should be placed between adjacent pieces of wood fastened together with bolts and also at both ends of the bolts. This will require 26 washers in all. While the size of the chair may be varied, it will be necessary to keep the proportions if the parts are to fold</p></div> </div>
