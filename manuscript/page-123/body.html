It serves as a pedestal and has one side which opens on hinges allowing the inside to be used as a smoker's cabinet or cellarette. All the lines are straight and the corners square, making it easy to   construct. White oak will make up best, although ash, birch or southern pine may be used with good effect.</p><blockquote class="  "><p>Stock of the following sizes should be bought, surfaced and cut to width and length:</p>
