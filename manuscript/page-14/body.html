Chisel out the grooves and round off the corners as shown in the sketch, using a 3/4-in. radius.</p><p>These parts may be put together and fastened to the upright by means of two long screws from the under side, placed to either side of the 1/2-in. hole. This hole must be continued through the pieces forming the base.</p><p>The braces are easiest made by taking the two pieces which were planed to 1-1/8 in. thick and 3 in. square and drawing a diagonal on each.
