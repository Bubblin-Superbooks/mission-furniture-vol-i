To do this, lay them on a flat surface with the ends square and mark them with a try-square. The tenons on the end and side rails are laid out in the same manner as the posts. The end rails should be marked and mortises cut for the upright slats as shown in the detail drawing. Fit the end and side braces with mortise and tenon joints.</p><p>The two end frames can now be glued and clamped together and set away to dry. Put all the parts together before gluing to see that they fit square and tight.</p></div> </div>
