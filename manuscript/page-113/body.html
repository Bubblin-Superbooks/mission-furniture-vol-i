<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><ul><li>2 keys, 1 by 1 by 3-1/2 in.</li><li>6 cleats, 1 by 1 by 4 in.</li></ul><p>The dimensions given, with the exception of the keys and cleats, are 1/2 in. longer than necessary for squaring up the ends.</p><p>The two rails are cut slanting from a point 1-1/2   in. from each end to the center, making them only 3 in. wide in the middle. The rails are "let into" the edges of the ends so the outside of the rails and end boards will be flush. The joints are put together with glue and screws. The cleats are fastened with screws to the inside of the rails and to the top. The stretcher has a tenon cut on each end which fits into a mortise cut in each end. The tenons will have sufficient length to cut the small mortise for the key.</p></div> </div>
