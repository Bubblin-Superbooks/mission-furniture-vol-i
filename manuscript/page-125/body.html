Over these, fit the sides and back and fasten them with screws or nails. The four corner blocks are now put under the base.</p><p>Two or more shelves may be set in as shown. Brass or copper hinges will look well if a dark stain is to be used.</p><p>Around the sides and back a 1-in. strip should be fastened to the base to give added strength.</p><p>If a dull finish is desired, apply two coats of stain and two of prepared wax. If a polished surface is wanted, first fill the pores of the wood with any standard filler, which can be purchased at a paint store. After this has dried partly, rub off any surplus filler, rubbing across the grain of the wood.   When perfectly dry apply one coat of shellac and as many coats of varnish as desired, rubbing down each coat, except the last, with No. 00 sandpaper and pumice stone.</p></div> </div>
